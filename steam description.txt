Long term goals:

- more weird stuff right-wingers and "right-wingers" do, cause I'm not trying to be b[i][b]i[/b][/i]ased, that's the main point of this mod
- probably more weird stuff "left-wingers" do
- some form of referendum mechanic: civil rights, narcotics, fission energy, eu membership, who knows (I'm testing this in my Italy mod)
- as stated above, maybe break down and expand 20th Century Trauma into modernity\world wars\cold war traumas
- this mod will eventually split into at least 3 more; Geography, Infrastructure and Trade --- 21th Century Challenges --- Growth and Demography (this one already exist in its early stage; https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2857163779 )
-An additional mod to interface these ones with the best mods around, and a mod to collect fix and update all the good but obsolete ones that are around
-at some point I'll test the viability of a "hidden neurons" mod; this game is all good and fun until you realize some of the worst problem are the ones you don't realize you have. What if you didn't actually know how much crime you have going on? What if you were leaking money? What if ya mum ran on batteries? Doesn't it sound like fun??
- i wonder if i can build an oscillator into the game, lol
- [b]some policies, yeah I know[/b]
- write the descriptions and make the icons (would appreciate a hand with the latter), I guess
- i'm thinking about it

daddy cliffski pls give us modders:

- more flexibility and reliability for the Equation Processor
- more modding documentation in general
- ??? what's up with global, freq and perc?? What's the difference?
(I think I figured it out, perc for causes and freq as a y in effects, but this NEEDS to be mentioned in the guide)
- whatever PARAdoxiBLE asks for
- just more moddable stuff - on that note - again, why don't all vanilla countries have their own tag?
- load order may be important at that point i guess
- more blog rants
- neuron groups: eg mode of transport, energy mix, earnings distribution, demography etc; perhaps sharing a pie chart if appropriate; not even necessarily anything functionally different, but it would at least de-clutter the UI and present data better.
(I'm managing ("Trackers") by using a situation (to make it stand out...) to group NOICON simulations\situations)
- neutral\misc (yellow?) situations and MIDGOOD simulations tags
- i'm thinking about you

(alpa) = barelly working, just laid the foundation and testing stuff
