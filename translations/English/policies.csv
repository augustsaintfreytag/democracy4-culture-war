#,TVFee,Broadcasting Fee,"A mandatory fee charged to households who own televisions or other broadcasting devices, used to fund public broadcasting services. This fee ensures independent media programming free from commercial interests, though it's often viewed as an outdated concept in the age of streaming services. Socialists tend to support this as a way to maintain quality public programming, while capitalists see it as an unnecessary tax burden."
#,PrintMediaGrants,Print Media Grants,"Government funding provided to struggling newspapers and print media outlets to help them survive in an increasingly digital world. This support helps maintain local journalism and investigative reporting, though critics argue it creates dependency on state funding and could influence editorial independence. Socialists view this as protecting vital democratic institutions, while capitalists see it as interfering with natural market evolution."
#,ApologyLaw,Fascism Prevention Act,"A law that criminalizes the promotion or defense of past authoritarian regimes, including their symbols, salutes, and political organizing. Modeled after Italy's post-WWII Scelba Law, this measure aims to prevent the revival of disbanded extremist movements. While liberals generally support it as essential for democracy, critics argue it infringes on free speech."
