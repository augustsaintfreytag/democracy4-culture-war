#,TVFee,Broadcasting Fee,"A mandatory fee charged to households who own televisions or other broadcasting devices, used to fund public broadcasting services. This fee ensures independent media programming free from commercial interests, though it's often viewed as an outdated concept in the age of streaming services. Socialists tend to support this as a way to maintain quality public programming, while capitalists see it as an unnecessary tax burden."
#,PrintMediaGrants,Print Media Grants,"Government funding provided to struggling newspapers and print media outlets to help them survive in an increasingly digital world. This support helps maintain local journalism and investigative reporting, though critics argue it creates dependency on state funding and could influence editorial independence. Socialists view this as protecting vital democratic institutions, while capitalists see it as interfering with natural market evolution."
#,ApologyLaw,Fascism Prevention Act,"A law that criminalizes the promotion or defense of past authoritarian regimes, including their symbols, salutes, and political organizing. Modeled after Italy's post-WWII Scelba Law, this measure aims to prevent the revival of disbanded extremist movements. While liberals generally support it as essential for democracy, critics argue it infringes on free speech."
#,ImmigrationTax,Immigration Tax,"Immigration policies are inherently hard to politically navigate. One part of the population wants looser regulations, others want tighter regulations, most just want a system that makes sense. An almost certainly controversial proposed policy to our system would be applying an added tax to the income of prospective new migrants until they complete the naturalization process. On one hand it would most certainly grant our government with more revenue and could be a compromise for looser immigration polcies, on the other hand most would likely consider it unfair to raise the tax against the income of those trying to learn how to fit into a new society and may just discourage most to pursue illegal routes of immigration to avoid the tax altogether."
#,AgeofConsent,Age of Consent,"Age of consent laws entail the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent by the state to consent to sexual acts. Psychologists, parents, politicians, and even the youth population at large have a hard time coming to an agreement on a variety of controversial factors in regards to what the age of consent should be. Despite this our population will still appreciate us having a definitive law in our books."
#,DrivingAge,Driving Age,"The driving age is the minimum age at which a person may obtain certification to lawfully drive a motor vehicle on public roads within our nation. Having a lower legal driving age in comparison to most nations will certainly increase our nation's motorist population and car demand, but it will also lead to concerns from some parents that their youth aren't ready to navigate the dangers of the road. The opposite can be true with a higher comparable driving age, where the youth population would certainly be expressing their frustration having to wait longer for transportational independence."
#,ConservationSubsidies,Conservation Subsidies,"Granting government subsidies to wildlife foundations, non-profit organizations, and private entities that provide conservation efforts is a good way for our nation to involve itself in the protection of natural ecosystems. It can also be a strong financial incentive for other organized entities and individuals to involve themselves in our nation's conservation effort."
#,BanCommercialFishing,Ban Commercial Fishing,"The commericial fishing industry provides our nation with a steady bounty of food sourced from our waters and good job opportunities for our citizens, however, to accomodate with a growing population's food demand commericial fishing liners have had to take more and more fish from our seas leading to concerns about overfishing. Some enviromentalists have suggested banning the industry practice of commericial fishing either temporarily or altogether is neccesary to allow our ocean's fish population to recover. Enacting such a policy though will certainly enrage members of the business community and disenfranchise the workers who make their living from the industry."
#,ExtraditionPolicy,Extradition Policy,Our nation's extradition policy represents the attitude our government maintains towards the enforcement of extradition treaties we have signed with other nations. It is common for nations to have extradition treaties between their allies and some will even extradite suspected criminals to nations with same or similar law structures to their own. Liberals may feel as though we are sending individuals off to prison in other nations and patriots may feel as if our nation's sovereignty is being weakend if our extradition policy is seen as too loose.
